# Lab 5 - *InstaParse - Pt 1*

Submitted by: **66377**

**InstaParse** is an app that allows us to clone some of the main functionalities of Instagram. We have the ability to create users. Those users are then able to sign up, and login to Instaparse where they can select photos from their photo album to post of their feed. All user authentication and data from Instaparse will be saved and accessed via a remote custome Parse backend server. 

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total
